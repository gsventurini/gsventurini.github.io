Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Government & Public Policy at the University of Strathclyde, which I joined in May 2024. Here, I work on the [Politician, Policies, and the Reproduction of Wealth](https://wealthpolicies.eu/) project, founded by the Volkswagen Foundation, alongside [Dr. Despina Alexiadou](https://alexiadou.com/).

My research agenda focuses on investigating how institutional change impacts various outcomes, including both institutional and behavioral aspects, such as support for the radical right, executive cabinet composition, political knowledge, and women's representation in politics.

Before moving to Glasgow, I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at Florida State University and a BSc and MSc in Economics at Bocconi University.
